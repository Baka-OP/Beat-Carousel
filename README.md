# Beat Carousel

Beat Carousel is a rhythm game inspired by OSU! and tiled rhythm games. It is currently being created in raylib_cs.

The main objective of the player is to click the nodes as the object approaches them. The proximity to the nodes decide the points and rank. 

It is currently indevelopment and I will continue to develop it until late october.
